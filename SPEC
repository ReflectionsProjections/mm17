'''Section I: Game Description'''

 * 2D
 * Turn based game that mimics an RTS.
 * Simultaneous game with multiple players.
 * Coordinate system map, infinite integral.
   * Space wraps after huge barren area surrounding solar system.
   * Manually designed maps (several small for arena, large for main game)

Player:

 * Starts with one planet and one ship.
 * As long as you have one base planet, you are stil in the game.
 * Method list:
   * info()
      * name
      * id
      * ore_amount
      * ships
      * bases
      * refinery
      * color
   * forfeit()

Planets, Bases, and Asteroids:

 * Livable planet (bases) or mining asteroids.
   * Livable Planets:
     * You can build a base on a livable planet.
     * Method list:
       * info()
         * owner
   * Mining Asteroids:
     * Generates a certain amount of ore per turn.
     * A player controls a planet, and to claim it you must destroy the mining rig.
     * Method list:
      * info()
   * Base:
     * You can build ships from a base.
     * To form a base on a planet it takes a certain number of turns.  
     * Bases have defense, but you also need to defend it externally while forming a base.
     * Minimal defense system once base is formed.  Enough to take on one ship, but not a fleet.
     * A player must destroy another player's base in order to capture the planet
     * Method list:
       * build_ship()
       * repair_ship(shipid)
       * shoot(angle)
       * salvage(shipid)
       * destroy()
       * info()
          * health
          * owner
          * queue
          * current_action
       * radar()
       * scan(shipid)

   * Refinery
     * Method list:
       * info()
          * health
          * owner
       * destroy()


Ships:

 * Built from planets.  
 * Consumes ore.
 * Different costs for different ships.
 * Shooting based on vectors (Angle and preset speed per weapon type).
 * Start off with 3 points (Level 1), can go up to 15 based on experience (Level 5, increments by 3).
   * A ship has 1 point in each category to start
 * Points can be allocated to Weapons, Shields, and Speed.
 * To repair a ship, you must return to a base and repair, disabling all other functions.
 * Ship scan feature within a certain radius of your ship.
 * Can tell Level far off due to size.
 * Method list:
   * shoot(angle) <- fire a weapon
   * move(angle) <- set a direction
   * add_point(system) <- put point into talent tree
   * radar() <- surrounding area
   * info(shipid) <- info on ship, can be yourself  
      * health
      * id
      * position
      * talent_tree
      * level
      * experience -- privliged
      * owner
   * build_base(planet)
   * build_refinery(planet)
 * Lasers
   * Method list:
     * info()
       * id
       * owner
       * velocity <- angle, origin
